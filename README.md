# 📖 Overview

**Interview Trainer AI** is an intelligent **Agentic AI-powered interview preparation platform** that helps students and professionals prepare for technical and HR interviews through personalized question generation, AI-based answer evaluation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and customized learning roadmaps.

The platform leverages **IBM watsonx.ai Granite Foundation Models** along with a **multi-agent architecture** to simulate a real interview experience. It understands the user's profile, generates company-specific interview questions, evaluates responses using AI, identifies weak areas, and recommends personalized study plans for continuous improvement.

By combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **ChromaDB**, the system retrieves verified interview knowledge instead of relying only on LLM memory, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving response accuracy.

  - Job Role
  - Experience Level
  - Target Company
  - Interview Category

- Evaluate interview answers using AI

- Provide detailed strengths & weaknesses analysis

- Generate personalized learning roadmaps
